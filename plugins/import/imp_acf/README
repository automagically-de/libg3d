Airfoils:
=========

* get airfoil data in .dat format, e.g. from:
  http://www.ae.uiuc.edu/m-selig/ads/archives/coord_seligFmt.tar.gz
  (search for "UIUC Airfoil Coordinates Database" if this link is broken)
* set the environment variable AIRFOIL_DIR to the path containing the
  dat files
* without airfoil data .acf models are still loadable, but wings and stuff
  are missing
